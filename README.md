2.7	E – R Diagrams
The structure of a system is defined and represented through a conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram not only outlines the existence of entities within the system but also depicts the relationships that exist between these entities and the cardinalities that are essential for maintaining the system's state.
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) serves as a visual representation of the relationships between different data objects. It is a notation used during the data modeling process, and it provides a clear overview of how data objects are interconnected. Additionally, the attributes associated with each data object are also noted in the ERD, allowing for detailed descriptions of the data objects.
 
The ERD consists of several primary components, including:
-	Data objects: These are the entities that represent the various elements within the system.
-	Relationships: They describe the associations and connections between different data objects.
-	Attributes: These define the characteristics and properties of the data objects.
-	Various types of indicators: These are symbols and notations used within the ERD to convey additional information or constraints.
The main purpose of the ERD is to illustrate the data objects and their relationships in a clear and concise manner. It provides a visual framework for understanding the structure and connections within the system.



 

























Chapter 3 System Design
 
3.1	Introduction
Software design is a crucial aspect of the software engineering process, occupying a central position in the technical realm. It is an essential step that applies to all development paradigms and domains of application. When creating any engineered product or system, design serves as the initial phase of the development process. The primary objective of the designer is to produce a model or representation of the entity that will be constructed later on.
Once the system requirements have been specified and analyzed, system design becomes the first of the three technical activities: design, code, and test. It is an integral part of building and verifying software. The significance of software design can be summarized in a single word: "Quality." Design is where quality is nurtured throughout the software development lifecycle. It provides us with representations of software that can be evaluated for quality. Design is the means by which we accurately transform a customer's vision into a tangible software product or system. It forms the foundation for all subsequent steps in software engineering. Without a robust design, we run the risk of constructing an unstable system—one that will be difficult to test and whose quality cannot be properly assessed until the final stages.
During the design phase, there is a continuous process of refining data structures, program structures, and procedural details. These refinements are reviewed, documented, and progressively improved upon. System design can be approached from both a technical and project management perspective. From a technical standpoint, design encompasses four key activities: architectural design, data structure design, interface design, and procedural design. These activities contribute to the overall design process and help shape the final software product or system.


3.2	Data flow diagrams
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical tool used to depict and analyze the flow of data within a system. It serves as a central tool and forms the foundation upon which other system components are developed. The movement of data from input to output, as well as through various processes, can be logically described and analyzed independently of the physical components associated with the system. These logical representations are referred to as logical data flow diagrams. On the other hand, physical data flow diagrams illustrate the actual implementation and movement of data between individuals, departments, and workstations within the system. A comprehensive system description typically consists of a set of data flow diagrams.
There are different notations used to develop data flow diagrams, with Yourdon, Gane, and Sarson notation being two commonly used approaches. Each component in a DFD is labeled with a descriptive name, and processes are further identified with numbers for identification purposes.
 
The development of DFDs is typically carried out in multiple levels. Each process in the lower- level diagrams can be decomposed into more detailed DFDs at the next level. The top-level diagram, often referred to as the context diagram, consists of a single process that plays a vital role in understanding the current system. The process depicted in the context level diagram is then expanded into other processes at the first level DFD.
The idea behind the process explosion into more detailed levels is to progressively increase the level of understanding and detail. This iterative process continues until an adequate level of detail is achieved, providing analysts with a comprehensive understanding of the system.
The DFD was originally developed by Larry Constantine as a means of expressing system requirements in a graphical form, leading to the concept of modular design.
Also known as a "bubble chart," the DFD serves the purpose of clarifying system requirements and identifying major transformations that will be translated into programs during the system design phase. It serves as the starting point for design, capturing the system's flow at different levels of detail. A DFD consists of a series of bubbles representing processes, connected by data flows within the system.


3.2.1	DFD Symbols:
In the DFD, there are four symbols:
1.	A square defines a source(originator) or destination of system data.
2.	An arrow identifies data flow. It is the pipeline through which the information flows.
3.	A circle or a bubble represents a process that transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flows.
4.	An open rectangle is a data store, data at rest or a temporary repository of data


 
3.2.2	Constructing A DFD
When drawing Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), several rules of thumb are followed to ensure clarity and consistency:
1.	Each process in the DFD should be named and numbered for easy reference. The name assigned to each process should accurately represent its function or purpose within the system.
2.	The direction of flow in the DFD is typically from top to bottom and from left to right. Data traditionally flow from a source to a destination, although there may be cases where data flow back to the source. To indicate this, a long flow line can be drawn back to the source. Alternatively, the source symbol can be repeated as a destination, marked with a short diagonal line to distinguish it from the original source symbol.
3.	When a process is decomposed into lower-level details, these subprocesses are numbered to indicate their hierarchical relationship within the DFD.
4.	Data store and destination names are written in capital letters, while process and data flow names have the first letter of each word capitalized.


In a DFD, data stores typically represent the minimum contents of data stored within them. Each data store should include all the relevant data elements that flow in and out of it.
It is important to note that the initial identification of interfaces, redundancies, and other aspects may not be fully captured in the DFD. Questionnaires are often used to gather additional information and ensure that all necessary interfaces, redundancies, and other components are accounted for. Interviews with stakeholders may also be conducted to supplement the DFD and capture any missing information.


3.2.3	Sailent features of DFD’S
1.	The DFD shows flow of data, not of control loops and decision are controlled considerations do not appear on a DFD.
2.	The DFD does not indicate the time factor involved in any process whether the dataflow tak place daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
3.	The sequence of events is not brought out on the DFD.


3.2.4	Types of data flow diagrams
1.	Current Physical.
2.	Current Logical.
3.	New Logical.
4.	New Physical.
 
3.2.5	Current physical
In Current Physical DFD processes label include the name of people or their positions or the names of computer systems that might provide some of the overall system-processing label includes an identification of the technology used to process the data. Similarly data flows and data stores are often labels with the names of the actual physical media on which data are stored such as file folders, computer files, business forms or computer tapes.
3.2.6	Current logical
The physical aspects at the system are removed as such as possible so that the current system is reduced to its essence to the data and the processors that transform them regardless of actual physical form.
3.2.7	New logical
This is exactly like a current logical model if the user were completely happy with the user were completely happy with the functionality of the current system but had problems with how it was implemented typically through the new logical model will differ from current logical model while having additional functions, absolute function removal and inefficient flows recognized.
3.2.8	New physical
The new physical represents only the physical implementation of the new system.


3.2.9	Rules governing the DFD’s
3.2.9.1	Process
-	No process can have only outputs.
-	No process can have only inputs. If an object has only inputs than it must be a sink.
-	A process has a verb phrase label.


3.2.9.2	Data store
-	Data cannot move directly from one data store to another data store, a process must move data.
-	Data cannot move directly from an outside source to a data store, a process, which receives, must move data from the source and place the data into data store
-	A data store has a noun phrase label.
 
3.2.9.3	Source or sink The origin and /or destination of data.
-	Data cannot move direly from a source to sink it must be moved by a process
-	A source and /or sink has a noun phrase land


3.2.9.4	Data flow
1.	A Data Flow has only one direction of flow between symbols. It may flow in both directions between a process and a data store to show a read before an update. The later is usually indicated however by two separate arrows since these happen at different type.
2.	A join in DFD means that exactly the same data comes from any of two or more different processes data store or sink to a common location.
3.	A data flow cannot go directly back to the same process it leads. There must be at least one other process that handles the data flow produce some other data flow returns the original data into the beginning process.
4.	A Data flow to a data store means update (delete or change).
5.	A data Flow from a data store means retrieve or use. A data flow has a noun phrase label more than one data flow noun phrase can appear on a single arrow as long as all of the flows on the same arrow move together as one package.

3.3	Unified Modeling Language Diagrams (UML)
Building a model for a software system prior to its construction is akin to having a blueprint for constructing a large building. Just as blueprints facilitate effective communication among construction teams, good models are crucial for effective communication among project teams in software development. As systems become more complex, the significance of employing sound modeling techniques increases. The use of visual notation to represent or model a problem offers several benefits, including enhanced clarity, familiarity, ease of maintenance, and simplification. The primary purpose of modeling is to reduce complexity. By creating an abstract representation of a system, known as a "model," we gain a deeper understanding of the system before building or modifying it. In this context, the term "system" encompasses various processes or structures, such as organizational structures, health services, computer software, instruction methods (including computer-based instruction), national economies, and more.
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) serves as a standardized set of notations and conventions for describing and modeling applications. It is designed to be a universal language for modeling systems, capable of expressing models for different kinds and purposes, similar to how programming languages or natural languages can be used in various ways.
The UML is primarily a graphical language with well-defined rules and semantics. It allows us to specify, construct, visualize, and document software systems and their components. These rules and semantics are expressed in English using a specification language called the "Object
Constraint Language" (OCL). OCL utilizes simple logic to specify the properties of a system.
It is important to note that the UML is not intended to be a visual programming language that replaces traditional programming languages with comprehensive visual and semantic support. However, the UML has a close relationship and mapping to object-oriented programming languages, allowing us to leverage the strengths of both worlds.


The UML (Unified Modeling Language) was designed with several primary goals in mind:
1.	Provide users with readily available and expressive visual modeling languages, enabling them to develop and exchange meaningful models effectively.
2.	Offer mechanisms for extendibility and specialization, allowing users to extend the core concepts of UML to suit their specific needs.
3.	Ensure independence from particular programming languages and development processes, making UML applicable across various contexts.
4.	Establish a formal basis for understanding the modeling language, enabling clear and unambiguous interpretation of UML models.
5.	Encourage the growth of the object-oriented (OO) tools market by providing a standard and widely accepted modeling language.
6.	Support higher-level development concepts, facilitating the representation and implementation of complex software systems.
 
The UML serves several purposes as a language:


-	Visualization: UML utilizes well-defined symbols to visually represent software systems, enabling developers or tools to interpret models created by other developers unambiguously.
-	Specification: UML allows for the precise and unambiguous specification of software systems, aiding in the construction of comprehensive and complete models.
-	Construction: UML facilitates the construction of software system models that can seamlessly communicate with a variety of programming languages, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.
-	Documentation: UML supports the documentation of software system models throughout the different stages of development, providing a means to capture and communicate important design and implementation details.
In summary, the primary goals of UML include providing users with expressive visual modeling languages, supporting extendibility and specialization, ensuring independence from programming languages and development processes, establishing a formal basis for understanding, promoting the growth of the OO tools market, supporting higher-level development concepts, and integrating best practices and methodologies. The UML language is used for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems, enabling clear communication and facilitating the development process.
3.3.1	Architectural views and diagrams of the UML
The UML Meta model elements are organized into diagrams. Different diagrams are used for different purposes depending on the angle from which you are viewing the system. The different views are called architectural views. Architectural views facilitate the organization of knowledge, and diagrams enable the communication of knowledge. Then knowledge itself is within the model or set of models that focuses on the problem and solution. The architectural views and their diagrams are summarized below:
3.3.1.1	The user model view
Encompasses a problem and solution from the preservative of those individuals whose problem the solution addresses. The view presents the goals and objectives of the problem owners and their requirements of the solution. This view is composed of use case diagrams. These diagrams describe the functionality provided by a system to external interactors. These diagrams contain actors, use cases, and their relationships.
3.3.1.2	The Structural model view
Encompasses the static, or structural, aspects of a problem and solution. This view is also known as the static or logical view. This view is composed of the following diagrams:
-	Class diagrams: describe the static structure of a system, or how it is declared rather than how it behaves. These diagrams contain classes and associations.
 
-	object diagrams: describe the static structure of a system at a particular time during its life.
These diagrams contain objects and links.


3.3.1.3	The behavioral model view
Encompasses the dynamic or behavioral aspects of a problem and solution. The view is also known as the dynamic, process, concurrent or collaborative view. This view is composed of the following diagrams:
-	Sequence diagrams: render the specification of behavior. These diagrams describes the behavior provided by a system to interactions. These diagrams contain classes that exchange messages with in an interaction arranged in time sequence. In generic form,
These diagrams describe a set of message exchange sequences among a set of classes. In
instance form(scenarios), these diagrams describe one actual message exchange sequence among objects of those classes.
-	Collaboration diagrams: render how behavior is realized by components with in a system.
These diagrams contain classes, associations, and their message exchanges with in a
collaboration to accomplish a purpose. In generic form, these diagrams describe a set of classes and associations involved in message exchange sequences. In instance
form(scenarios), these diagrams describe a set of objects of those classes links confirming to the associations, and one actual message exchange sequence that inconsistent with the generic form and uses those objects and links.
-	State chart diagrams: render the states and responses of a class participating in behavior, and the life cycle of an object. These diagrams describe the behavior of a class in response to external stimuli.
-	Activity diagrams: render the activities of a class participating in behavior. These diagrams describe the behavior of a class in response to internal processing rather than external
events. Activity diagrams describe the processing activities with in a class.
-	The Implementation model view: Encompasses the structural and behavioral aspects of
the solution's realization. This view is also known as the component or development view and is composed of component diagrams. These diagrams describe the organization of and dependencies among software implementation components. These diagrams contain components and their relationships.
-	The Environment model view: Encompasses the structural and behavioral aspects of the domain in which a solution must be realized. This view is also known as the deployment or physical view. This view is composed of deployment diagrams. These diagrams describe
the configuration of processing resources elements and the mapping of software
implementation components onto them. These diagrams contain nodes, components and their relationships.
 
3.3.2	UML diagrams

In today's digital age, we are surrounded by an overwhelming amount of information, products, and content. Recommendation systems help us navigate through this abundance by suggesting
 
items that are likely to be of interest to us. Whether it's personalized movie recommendations on streaming platforms, product recommendations on e-commerce websites, or song recommendations on music streaming services, these systems play a vital role in enhancing user experience and engagement.
Recommendation systems leverage machine learning techniques to analyze user data, understand their preferences, and make accurate predictions about their future interests. These systems typically operate in two main ways: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that users who have similar preferences in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. The system analyzes user behavior, such as ratings or purchase history, and identifies patterns or similarities between users. It then recommends items that are preferred by users with similar tastes. Collaborative filtering can be further classified into user-based filtering, where recommendations are made based on similar users, and item-based filtering, where recommendations are made based on similar items.
Content-based filtering, on the other hand, focuses on the characteristics or attributes of items themselves. The system analyzes the features or metadata of items and creates user profiles based on their preferences. It then recommends items that are similar to the ones that a user has previously shown interest in. Content-based filtering relies on understanding the content and context of items to make relevant recommendations.
Modern recommendation systems often combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. Additionally, advancements in machine learning have led to the development of more sophisticated recommendation techniques, such as matrix factorization, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, which can handle complex patterns and improve recommendation accuracy.
Recommendation systems have become an integral part of many online platforms, helping users discover new content, products, and services that align with their preferences. By personalizing the user experience, these systems enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and ultimately drive business growth. Moreover, they facilitate serendipitous discoveries, enabling users to explore new items they might not have otherwise encountered. However, building effective recommendation systems comes with challenges. Handling large-scale datasets, dealing with data sparsity, addressing the cold-start problem (where there is limited or no user history), and ensuring privacy and ethical considerations are some of the key challenges that developers and data scientists face.
In conclusion, machine learning plays a crucial role in recommendation systems, enabling platforms to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. These systems leverage collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user data and make accurate predictions. Recommendation systems enhance user experience, drive engagement, and help users discover relevant and interesting items in the vast digital landscape.

5.	Resource Intensive: Training complex machine learning models can require significant computational resources, including high-performance hardware and large amounts of memory. Deploying and running models in production may also require dedicated infrastructure. Resource-intensive requirements can limit the accessibility and scalability of machine learning solutions for smaller organizations or those with limited resources.
6.	Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Machine learning algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Privacy concerns also arise when sensitive data is used for training or when models inadvertently reveal private information. Proper data anonymization and ethical considerations are necessary to mitigate these risks.
7.	Concept Drift and Model Maintenance: Machine learning models may face challenges when the underlying data distribution changes over time, a phenomenon known as concept drift. Models may need to be retrained or updated to adapt to new patterns and trends. Model maintenance can be resource-intensive and requires continuous monitoring and updates to ensure the model's effectiveness and accuracy.
8.	Limited Human-like Understanding: Machine learning algorithms excel at pattern recognition and prediction but lack the human-like understanding of context, nuance, and common sense. They may struggle with complex reasoning, understanding sarcasm, or dealing with situations outside their training data. This limitation can impact their performance in certain domains and limit their applicability.
9.	Lack of Causal Inference: Machine learning models focus on correlations rather than causation. While they can predict outcomes based on observed patterns, they may not provide insights into the underlying causal relationships. This limitation can hinder decision-making in domains where understanding causality is crucial.
10.	Security Vulnerabilities: Machine learning models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious actors intentionally manipulate input data to mislead the model's predictions. These attacks can have serious consequences in security-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles or malware detection. Ensuring robustness and security against such attacks is an ongoing challenge.
Understanding these disadvantages is crucial to address the limitations and challenges associated with machine learning. Responsible implementation, careful selection of algorithms, rigorous data analysis, and ongoing monitoring are essential to mitigate these drawbacks and ensure the ethical and effective use of machine learning technologies.
4.4	MySQL SERVER
A database management, or DBMS, gives the user access to their data and helps them transform the data into information. Such database management systems include dBase, paradox, IMS, MySQL Server and MySQL Server. These systems allow users to create, update and extract information from their database. A database is a structured collection of
 
data. Data refers to the characteristics of people, things and events. MySQL Server stores each data item in its own fields. In MySQL Server, the fields relating to a particular person, thing or event are bundled together to form a single complete unit of data, called a record (it can also be referred to as raw or an occurrence). Each record is made up of a number of fields. No two fields in a record can have the same field name. During an MySQL Server Database design project, the analysis of your business needs identifies all the fields or attributes of interest. If your business needs change over time, you define any additional fields or change the definition of existing fields.


4.4.1	MySQL server tables
MySQL Server stores records relating to each other in a table. Different tables are created for the various groups of information. Related tables are grouped together to form a database.
4.4.2	Primary key
Every table in MySQL Server has a field or a combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in the table. The Unique identifier is called the Primary Key, or simply the Key. The primary key provides the means to distinguish one record from all other in a table. It allows the user and the database system to identify, locate and refer to one particular record in the database.
4.4.3	Relational database
Sometimes all the information of interest to a business operation can be stored in one table. MySQL Server makes it very easy to link the data in multiple tables. Matching an employee to the department in which they work is one example. This is what makes MySQL Server a relational database management system, or RDBMS. It stores data in two or more tables and enables you to define relationships between the table and enables you to define relationships between the tables.
4.4.4	Foreign key
When a field is one table matches the primary key of another field is referred to as a foreign key. A foreign key is a field or a group of fields in one table whose values match those of the primary key of another table.


4.4.5	Referential integrity
Not only does MySQL Server allow you to link multiple tables, it also maintains consistency between them. Ensuring that the data among related tables is correctly matched is referred to as maintaining referential integrity.
4.4.6	Data abstraction
 
A major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. This system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained. Data abstraction is divided into three levels. Physical level: This is the lowest level of abstraction at which one describes how the data are actually stored. Conceptual Level: At this level of database abstraction all the attributed and what data are actually stored is described and entries and relationship among them. View level: This is the highest level of abstraction at which one describes only part of the database.
4.4.7	Advantages of RDBMS
-	Redundancy can be avoided - Inconsistency can be eliminated
-	Data can be Shared
-	Standards can be enforced
-	Security restrictions ca be applied
-	Integrity can be maintained
-	Conflicting requirements can be balanced
-	Data independence can be achieved.


4.4.8	Disadvantages of DBMS
A significant disadvantage of the DBMS system is cost. In addition to the cost of purchasing of developing the software, the hardware has to be upgraded to allow for the extensive programs and the workspace required for their execution and storage. While centralization reduces duplication, the lack of duplication requires that the database be adequately backed up so that in case of failure the data can be recovered.


4.4.9	Features of SQL server (RDBMS)
MySQL SERVER is one of the leading database management systems (DBMS) because it is the only Database that meets the uncompromising requirements of today's most demanding information systems. From complex decision support systems (DSS) to the most rigorous online transaction processing (OLTP) application, even application that require simultaneous DSS and OLTP access to the same critical data, SQL Server leads the industry in both performance and capability
MySQL SERVER is a truly portable, distributed, and open DBMS that delivers unmatched performance, continuous operation and support for every database.
MySQL SERVER RDBMS is high performance fault tolerant DBMS which is specially designed for online transactions processing and for handling large database application.
MySQL SERVER with transactions processing option offers two features which contribute to very high level of transaction processing throughput, which are
 

4.4.9.1	Enterprise wide data sharing
The unrivaled portability and connectivity of the MySQL SERVER DBMS enables all the systems in the organization to be linked into a singular, integrated computing resource.
4.4.9.2	Portability
MySQL SERVER is fully portable to more than 80 distinct hardware and operating systems platforms, including UNIX, MSDOS, OS/2, Macintosh and dozens of proprietary platforms. This portability gives complete freedom to choose the database sever platform that meets the system requirements.
4.4.9.3	Open systems
MySQL SERVER offers a leading implementation of industry standard MySQL. MySQL Server's open architecture integrates MySQL SERVER and non SQL SERVER DBMS with industries most comprehensive collection of tools, application, and third party software products MySQL Server's Open architecture provides transparent access to data from other relational database and even nonrelational database.
4.4.9.4	Distributed data sharing
MySQL Server’s networking and distributed database capabilities to access data stored on remote server with the same ease as if the information was stored on a single local computer. A single MySQL statement can access data at multiple sites. You can store data where system requirements such as performance, security or availability dictate.
4.4.9.5	Unmatched performance
The most advanced architecture in the industry allows the MySQL SERVER DBMS to deliver unmatched performance.
4.4.10	Sophisticated concurrency control
Real World applications demand access to critical data. With most database Systems application becomes contention bound which performance is limited not by the CPU power or by disk I/O, but user waiting on one another for data access . MySQL Server employs full, unrestricted row- level locking and contention free queries to minimize and in many cases entirely eliminates contention wait times.
4.4.10.1	No i/o bottlenecks
MySQL Server’s fast commit groups commit and deferred write technologies dramatically reduce disk I/O bottlenecks. While some database write whole data block to disk at commit time, MySQL Server commits transactions with at most sequential log file on disk at commit time, On high throughput systems, one sequential writes typically group commit multiple transactions.
Data read by the transaction remains as shared memory so that other transactions may access that
 
data without reading it again from disk. Since fast commits write all data necessary to the recovery to the log file, modified blocks are written back to the database independently of the transaction commit, when written from memory to disk.

testing different loop conditions such as for-loops, while-loops, and do-while loops to ensure that the software responds correctly.

6.4	Methodology
Steps to follow while implementing the methodology are as follows:
1.	Start with a base function that you want to implement.
2.	Create a document with the detailed requirement definition, an activity diagram with a description of the flow, database tables to be used, a component diagram, and a description of each component with the precondition and tables that would be affected by the component.
3.	Give the document to the tester, and work with the tester while he or she writes the code to check if the steps in the document can be implemented and if the result of each use case can be achieved.
4.	If the tester finds a step difficult to implement or thinks he or she is missing additional information to implement the functionality, then go to step 2; otherwise, go to step 3.
5.	Ask the tester to log on all the errors and difficulties he or she encountered while working on the prototype implementation.
6.	Once the prototype is done and the results between the developer’s prototype and tester's prototype match, work on the other requirement, and expand the prototype to final software. 7. When the testing approach was implemented, the following pros and cons regarding the testing approach were realized.
The methodology of testing for the Triper is Agile Testing Methodology:
Agile testing methodology is a collaborative and iterative approach to testing that emphasizes continuous feedback and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders. For the Triper project, agile testing methodology could be suitable as it allows for continuous testing and feedback, which can help to ensure that the software meets the customer's needs and expectations.
6.4.1	Pros of using the methodology
